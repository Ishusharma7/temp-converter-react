this is a temprature converter programme from celsius to fehrenite and vice versa

Main techs in this project was  { lifting state, how to pass props, event handlers }

files --> celsius.js , fehrenite.js , style.css rendered the UI of the project 

App.js file rendered the working of the project like the conversion of the temprature inside onchange events in variables ccel and cfer respectively

as the app component updated the state on every change by these handlers and was rendered in index.js
